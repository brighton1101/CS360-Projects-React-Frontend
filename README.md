# Frontend Interface For My CS360 Artificial Intelligence Class Projects

### There is a backend web service available to check out [here](https://github.com/brighton1101/CS360Projects-With-Flask-Backend)
The apps work with one another

### Inspiration:
I wanted to create a backend Python app to serve up various AI projects that I did 
in my class over the course of the semester, and learn more about connecting/integrating existing scripts to a web service. Also, I wanted to gain more experience using Flask and writing basic web apps in Python.

### How It's Done
- Single page app (React) frontend that gets compiled by webpack into static site
- Allows users to switch between the various projects, and execute AI scripts by hitting Flask backend endpoint
- Shows users output

### Tech Used
- React
- Material UI
- Webpack
- Babel
